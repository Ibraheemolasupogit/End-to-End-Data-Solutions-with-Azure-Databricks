# Implementing Data Privacy and Governance using Unity Catalog with Azure Databricks

> **IMPORTANT**: This exercise assumes you have an Azure subscription in an organization where Unity Catalog for Azure Databricks is supported. Enabling Unity Catalog requires Azure Databricks account administrative access and access to tenant-level resources. If you do not have access to an environment that supports Unity Catalog, you will be unable to complete this exercise.
>
> See *[Set up and manage Unity Catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/get-started)* for more information.

Unity Catalog offers a centralized governance solution for data and AI, simplifying security by providing a single place to administer and audit data access. It supports fine-grained access control lists (ACLs) and dynamic data masking, which are essential for protecting sensitive information. 

This lab will take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

> **Note**: The Azure Databricks user interface is subject to continual improvement. The user interface may have changed since the instructions in this exercise were written.

## Before you start

You'll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) in which you have administrative-level access.

## Provision an Azure Databricks workspace

> **Tip**: If you already have a Unity Catalog enabled Azure Databricks workspace, you can skip this procedure and use your existing workspace.

This exercise includes a script to provision a new Azure Databricks workspace. The script attempts to create a *Premium* tier Azure Databricks workspace resource in a region in which your Azure subscription has sufficient quota for the compute cores required in this exercise; and assumes your user account has sufficient permissions in the subscription to create an Azure Databricks workspace resource. If the script fails due to insufficient quota or permissions, you can try to [create an Azure Databricks workspace interactively in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/getting-started/#--create-an-azure-databricks-workspace).

1. In a web browser, sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com`.
2. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***PowerShell*** environment. The cloud shell provides a command line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal, as shown here:

    ![Azure portal with a cloud shell pane](./images/cloud-shell.png)

    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a *Bash* environment, switch it to ***PowerShell***.

3. Note that you can resize the cloud shell by dragging the separator bar at the top of the pane, or by using the **&#8212;**, **&#10530;**, and **X** icons at the top right of the pane to minimize, maximize, and close the pane. For more information about using the Azure Cloud Shell, see the [Azure Cloud Shell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

4. In the PowerShell pane, enter the following commands to clone this repo:

     ```powershell
    rm -r mslearn-databricks -f
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-databricks
     ```

5. After the repo has been cloned, enter the following command to run the **setup.ps1** script, which provisions an Azure Databricks workspace in an available region:

     ```powershell
    ./mslearn-databricks/setup.ps1
     ```

6. If prompted, choose which subscription you want to use (this will only happen if you have access to multiple Azure subscriptions).

7. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 5 minutes, but in some cases may take longer. While you are waiting, review the [Data governance with Unity Catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/data-governance/) article in the Azure Databricks documentation.

## Create a cluster

Azure Databricks is a distributed processing platform that uses Apache Spark *clusters* to process data in parallel on multiple nodes. Each cluster consists of a driver node to coordinate the work, and worker nodes to perform processing tasks. In this exercise, you'll create a *single-node* cluster to minimize the compute resources used in the lab environment (in which resources may be constrained). In a production environment, you'd typically create a cluster with multiple worker nodes.

> **Tip**: If you already have a cluster with a 13.3 LTS or higher runtime version in your Azure Databricks workspace, you can use it to complete this exercise and skip this procedure.

1. In the Azure portal, browse to the **msl-*xxxxxxx*** resource group that was created by the script (or the resource group containing your existing Azure Databricks workspace)

1. Select your Azure Databricks Service resource (named **databricks-*xxxxxxx*** if you used the setup script to create it).

1. In the **Overview** page for your workspace, use the **Launch Workspace** button to open your Azure Databricks workspace in a new browser tab; signing in if prompted.

    > **Tip**: As you use the Databricks Workspace portal, various tips and notifications may be displayed. Dismiss these and follow the instructions provided to complete the tasks in this exercise.

1. In the sidebar on the left, select the **(+) New** task, and then select **Cluster** (you may need to look in the **More** submenu).

1. In the **New Cluster** page, create a new cluster with the following settings:
    - **Cluster name**: *User Name's* cluster (the default cluster name)
    - **Policy**: Unrestricted
    - **Cluster mode**: Single Node
    - **Access mode**: Single user (*with your user account selected*)
    - **Databricks runtime version**: 13.3 LTS (Spark 3.4.1, Scala 2.12) or later
    - **Use Photon Acceleration**: Selected
    - **Node type**: Standard_D4ds_v5
    - **Terminate after** *20* **minutes of inactivity**

1. Wait for the cluster to be created. It may take a minute or two.

    > **Note**: If your cluster fails to start, your subscription may have insufficient quota in the region where your Azure Databricks workspace is provisioned. See [CPU core limit prevents cluster creation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/kb/clusters/azure-core-limit) for details. If this happens, you can try deleting your workspace and creating a new one in a different region. You can specify a region as a parameter for the setup script like this: `./mslearn-databricks/setup.ps1 eastus`

## Create a schema in Unity Catalog

Unity Catalog metastores register metadata about securable objects (such as tables, volumes, external locations, and shares) and the permissions that govern access to them. Each metastore exposes a three-level namespace (`catalog`.`schema`.`table`) by which data can be organized. You must have one metastore for each region in which your organization operates. To work with Unity Catalog, users must be on a workspace that is attached to a metastore in their region.

1. In the sidebar, select **Catalog**.

2. In the Catalog explorer, a default Unity Catalog with your workspace name (**databricks-*xxxxxxx*** if you used the setup script to create it) should be present. Select the catalog, then at the top of the right pane select **Create schema**.

3. Name the new schema **ecommerce**, choose the storage location created with your workspace, and select **Create**.

4. Select your catalog and in the right pane select the **Workspaces** tab. Verify that your workspace has `Read & Write` access to it.

## Ingest data into Unity Catalog

1. Download the sample data files:
   * [customers.csv](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-databricks/raw/main/data/DE-05/customers.csv)
   * [products.csv](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-databricks/raw/main/data/DE-05/products.csv)
   * [sales.csv](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-databricks/raw/main/data/DE-05/sales.csv)

2. In the Azure Databricks workspace, at the top of the catalog explorer, select **+** and then select **Add data**.

3. In the new window, select **Upload files to volume**.

4. In the new window, navigate to your `ecommerce` schema, expand it and select **Create a volume**.

5. Name the new volume **sample_data** and select **Create**.

6. Select the new volume and upload the files `customers.csv`, `products.csv`, and `sales.csv`. Select **Upload**.

7. In the sidebar, use the **(+) New** link to create a **Notebook**. In the **Connect** drop-down list, select your cluster if it is not already selected. If the cluster is not running, it may take a minute or so to start.

8. In the first cell of the notebook, enter the following code to create tables from the CSV files:

     ```python
    # Load Customer Data
    customers_df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("/Volumes/databricksxxxxxxx/ecommerce/sample_data/customers.csv")
    customers_df.write.saveAsTable("ecommerce.customers")

    # Load Sales Data
    sales_df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("/Volumes/databricksxxxxxxx/ecommerce/sample_data/sales.csv")
    sales_df.write.saveAsTable("ecommerce.sales")

    # Load Product Data
    products_df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("/Volumes/databricksxxxxxxx/ecommerce/sample_data/products.csv")
    products_df.write.saveAsTable("ecommerce.products")
     ```

>**Note:** In the `.load` file path, replace `databricksxxxxxxx` with your catalog name.

9. In the catalog explorer, navigate to the `ecommerce` schema and verify that the new tables are inside it.
    
## Set up ACLs and dynamic data masking

Access control lists (ACLs) are a fundamental aspect of data security in Azure Databricks, allowing you to configure permissions for various workspace objects. With the Unity Catalog, you can centralize the governance and auditing of data access, providing a fine-grained security model that is essential for managing data and AI assets. 

1. In a new cell, run the following code to create a secure view of the `customers` table to restrict access to PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data.

     ```sql
    CREATE VIEW ecommerce.customers_secure_view AS
    SELECT 
        customer_id, 
        name, 
        address,
        city,
        state,
        zip_code,
        country, 
        CASE 
            WHEN current_user() = 'admin_user@example.com' THEN email
            ELSE NULL 
        END AS email, 
        CASE 
            WHEN current_user() = 'admin_user@example.com' THEN phone 
            ELSE NULL 
        END AS phone
    FROM ecommerce.customers;
     ```

2. Query the secure view:

     ```sql
    SELECT * FROM ecommerce.customers_secure_view
     ```

Verify that access to PII columns (email and phone) is restricted as you are not accessing the data as `admin_user@example.com`.

## Clean up

In Azure Databricks portal, on the **Compute** page, select your cluster and select **&#9632; Terminate** to shut it down.

If you've finished exploring Azure Databricks, you can delete the resources you've created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs and free up capacity in your subscription.
